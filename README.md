## Using PS4 Cover Generator Offline
PS4 Cover Generator can be used online or offline, depending on your preferences. If you'd like to use PS4 Cover Generator offline on your computer, [**click here**](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/ps4-cover-generator/archive/master.zip) to download the repository. Once downloaded all you need to do is unzip the files, and when everything is unzipped you can start using PS4 Cover Generator by opening any of the **index.html** files in the browser of your choice!

There are only minor limitations for using the offline version of PS4 Cover Generator, those are:
- You will not be able to use it on your PS4, unless hosting a local site.
- Fonts imported from Google will not be available, ONLY if you have no internet connection. (this includes 99% of the fonts available; only Default and FontAwesome will be useable)
- New images/updates will not be available; you have to download the latest version of PS4 Cover Generator from Github to get them.

Aside from these minor drawbacks, PS4 Cover Generator works great for offline use.

## What's the point of this project?
The main goal of the PS4 Cover Generator web app is to provide PlayStation 4 system owners with an easy-to-use tool for creating simple or complex Cover Images directly on their PS4 console. It's a great alternative for people who do not own a PC/Phone, but want to make a personalized Cover for their PSN account.
